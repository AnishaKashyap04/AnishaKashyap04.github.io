            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Dr. Anisha Kashyap, currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA). My work focuses on nonlinear dynamics, complex systems, recurrence quantification analysis, and their applications to astrophysical and biological systems. I hold a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Mumbai and have worked across a range of interdisciplinary projects involving modeling, simulation, and data analysis.</p>

                <p><strong>Department of Physics -University of Mumbai - Mumbai, Maharashtra (India)</strong></p>
                <p><em>Thesis :</em> Nonlinear Dynamical Modelling of Swaying of Branched Structures - The work involved formulation of the model for swaying of trees, its numerical analysis and also experimental tracking of motion of small plants in a wind tunnel. The analytical component of the thesis consisted of deriving the equations of motions using Lagrangian formulation, attempting their approximate solutions using Adomian decomposition and linear stability analysis. In the numerical part, the equations were solved numerically (using GSL/ Octave), analyzed to study chaos (finding the Lyapunov exponent) and to study synchronization between different elements. Nonlinear time series was also carried out of the solutions as well as the experimental signals obtained from tracking experiments.</p>
